# Git Intent CLI

🎯 A Git commit interface for developers who want their work to reflect **purpose**, **principles**, and **meaning** — not just code changes.

---

## ✨ What Is This?

`git-intent` helps you commit code with **intentional structure**, aligning each commit to:

- **Essence** – the higher purpose (e.g. Simplicity, Security)
- **Ethic** – the guiding principle (e.g. Reduce Friction, Build Trust)
- **Expression** – the actual implementation or change

---

## 🚀 Example Usage

```bash
intent commit \
  --essence "Simplicity" \
  --ethic "Reduce friction" \
  --expression "Removed redundant form step"
```
Creates a commit like:
```css
[Essence:  Simplicity] [Ethic: Reduce friction] Removed redundant form step
```

## 🔧 Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/tylerlazenby/git-intent-cli.git
cd git-intent-cli
npm install
npm link
```

## Planned Features
- ✅ Cross-platform CLI (Windows/macOS/Linux)
- ✅ Commit command with metadata
- 🛠️ .intentrc config file
- 🧠 Saved intent presets
- 🌿 intent branch with semantic naming
- 📊 Value dashboard/history tracking

## 💡 Why?
Because Git history should reflect more than technical changes.
It should document your **growth**, **values**, and **mission**.
